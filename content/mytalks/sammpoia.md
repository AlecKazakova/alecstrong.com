title: Shipping A Mobile Multiplatform Project on iOS & Android
---

_Presented with Ben Asher_

Getting a multiplatform project started within an active engineering team across multiple platforms is challenging. You have to pitch the project to your colleagues, wrestle with reconciling platform-specific technical issues, and actually ship it for each supported platform.

We have spent the last year doing just that for PlanGrid and CashApp. Come learn how to get your multiplatform project started and what kinds of problems you can expect to solve along the way. We'll approach the problems from both the Android and iOS perspectives and arm you with the tools to make multiplatform not a multiproblem.
