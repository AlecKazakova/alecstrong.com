# A Multiplatform Delight

_Presented with Jake Wharton_

SQL Delight, a type-safe database API, recently completed migration from being a Java-generating, Android-specific tool to a Kotlin-generating, multiplatform one. Migrating an API from Java to Kotlin has obvious benefits, but adding multiplatform support for iOS introduces a dynamic which complicates the API, code generation, and runtime.

This talk will cover the challenges of platform-agnostic API design, type-safe multiplatform Kotlin code generation, and the integration of platform-specific runtimes such that the library not only runs efficiently on each platform but also integrates well with the other languages each might be using.
