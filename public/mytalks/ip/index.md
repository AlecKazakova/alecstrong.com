# IntelliJ Plugins

A brief introduction to IntelliJ plugin architectures and a guide on how to navigate the IntelliJ APIs. Since everything is extendable in IntelliJ you are enabled to build nearly anything you can imagine, but the breadth of APIs and lack of thorough documentation also means starting out is very daunting. Through this presentation you will gain an understanding of the IntelliJ API design and the skills to get started on building tools.
