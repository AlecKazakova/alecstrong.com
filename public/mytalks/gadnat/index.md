# Good APIs Don't Need a Tutorial

Working in an enormous codebase is hard. You're new and you don't know where to start. There's a ton of tools available to you and you don't know which to pick.

Building that codebase is just as hard - but there's a trick to making it fantastic. This talk is going to draw corollaries between API design and video game design, and we're all going to learn from the greatest game design in the game on how to be friendly to newcomers. It's simpler than you think, but doing it right is challenging. We'll use open source examples and talk about how we've used this strategy at CashApp to great effect.

It's super effective!
